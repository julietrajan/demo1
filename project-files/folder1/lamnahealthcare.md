# Fortify Lamna Healthcare's Data

## Introduction:

Once upon a time in the bustling city of Techville, there was a renowned healthcare organization called Lamna Healthcare. 
Lamna Healthcare was known for its cutting-edge medical research and exceptional patient care. However, as the organization grew, so did its data security concerns. They needed to ensure that their patient data, stored in Azure SQL Database, was accessed privately and securely, without exposure to the public internet.

The IT team at Lamna Healthcare, led by the brilliant and meticulous Sarah, was tasked with finding a solution. Sarah knew that the stakes were high; patient data was sensitive and needed the highest level of protection. She gathered her team for a brainstorming session to evaluate their options.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277e75aa-48f0-4699-be64-adb32d93d8ad)
