# Smart City Initiative - Single Service Vs Multi-Service Account

## Introduction

City of Innovaville is launching a Smart City Initiative to improve urban living through technology. The city plans to use Azure AI services to enhance various aspects of city management, including traffic monitoring, public safety, and environmental monitoring.

#### Single Service Example: Traffic Monitoring
For traffic monitoring, Innovaville decides to use Azure Computer Vision to analyze live video feeds from traffic cameras. Since this task requires a specialized AI service focused on image and video analysis, they create a single-service resource for Azure Computer Vision. This allows them to have granular control over the specific capabilities and configurations needed for traffic monitoring.

#### Multi-Service Example: Public Safety and Environmental Monitoring
For public safety and environmental monitoring, Innovaville needs to integrate multiple AI services. They plan to use:

- Azure Text Analytics to analyze social media posts and detect potential public safety threats.<br>
- Azure Speech Services to transcribe emergency calls and analyze the sentiment of callers.<br>
- Azure Anomaly Detector to monitor environmental sensors for unusual patterns in air quality and noise levels.

To streamline management and billing, Innovaville creates a multi-service resource. This allows them to access all these AI services with a single set of credentials and a unified endpoint, simplifying integration and reducing administrative overhead.

### Instructions for Flip Cards
Below are questions based on the scenario. Each question is on one side of a flip card. Flip the card to see the answer.
