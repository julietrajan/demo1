# VanArsdel's Journey to Azure AD

## Introduction:

VanArsdel Ltd, a mid-sized technology company, had been thriving for years with its robust on-premises infrastructure. The company's IT environment was managed by a dedicated team led by the experienced IT manager, Raj. VanArsdel Ltd. relied heavily on its on-premises Active Directory (ADDS) to manage user identities, access control, and resources within the company's network.
VanArsdel's on-premises ADDS was the backbone of its IT operations. It provided a secure and controlled environment where user accounts, computers, and other resources were managed centrally. Raj and his team of IT administrators used Domain Controllers to enforce security policies, manage user authentication, and ensure that only authorized personnel could access sensitive data. The system worked well, but it required significant maintenance, regular updates, and physical infrastructure to keep everything running smoothly.
As the company grew, they faced new challenges. Employees started working remotely more frequently, and the demand for cloud-based applications and services increased. Raj realized that the traditional on-premises ADDS setup was becoming a bottleneck, limiting the company's ability to adapt to the changing work environment.
To address these challenges, they decided to explore Microsoft Entra ID. Raj and his team began the gathering the details for migration process, integrating Microsoft Entra ID with their existing on-premises ADDS to create a hybrid environment, leveraging  the strengths of both systems.

Your goal is to help the team identify which features or services belong to ADDS and which ones belong to Microsoft Entra ID.
