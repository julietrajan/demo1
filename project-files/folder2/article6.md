## Case Study: HEINEKENâ€™s Digital Transformation and Security Strategy

HEINEKEN, a global brewing company, has set an ambitious goal to become the best-connected brewer by digitalizing customer interactions and simplifying its IT landscape. With operations in over 80 countries, HEINEKEN faces significant cybersecurity challenges due to the increasing threat landscape. To address these challenges, HEINEKEN adopted a comprehensive security strategy, focusing on integrating advanced security tools and services.
The company transitioned from a fragmented and siloed security model to a seamless, integrated one. They adopted a hybrid security model, combining internal control with outsourced 24/7 security operations. Emphasizing Zero Trust principles, HEINEKEN ensures continuous verification of identities to maintain a secure digital environment.
HEINEKEN uses a variety of Microsoft Security solutions to protect its digital transformation efforts. Microsoft 365 E5 provides a comprehensive suite of advanced security features. The Microsoft Defender Suite, including Defender for Cloud, Defender for Cloud Apps, Defender for Endpoint, and Defender for Identity, offers protection for cloud environments, app usage, endpoints, and identities, respectively. Additionally, Microsoft Entra ID is used for identity and access management, while Microsoft Sentinel serves as the security information and event management (SIEM) tool for monitoring and response.
By leveraging these tools, HEINEKEN has enhanced its security posture and agility, improved visibility and control over its IT environment, and ensured the ability to innovate securely while supporting global operations.
